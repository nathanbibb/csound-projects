# Works for Tone Generator 2

## Introduction

This set of Csound files is a work that builds on my first "Works for Tone
Generator", originally titled "Six Miniatures for Timothy Mills", composed in
eighteen years ago in 2004.  That work consisted of various tones generated in
Csound, but arranged and shaped (e.g. faded in and out, voulme, etc.) in
ProTools.

Those ProTools files are now almost lost to me, due to limitations of closed
source software and compatibility.  My only access to those files is on an old
Mac Mini with my old version of ProTools on it, but I cannot export the details
of the session of anything to my more modern computers running Linux.

While I have worked with an open source audio program called Ardour, I thought
the best way to compose a successor to "Works for Tone Generator" would be to
write the entire composition in CSound, since this is its origin, and I would
be able to store the composition in text in version control, unlike the binary
forms that even an open source platform like Ardour would require.
