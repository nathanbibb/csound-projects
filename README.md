# Nathan Bibb's Csound Projects

Over the course of the last 20 years or so, I've tried to learn Csound, and I've used it in some rudimentary ways on and off in a few compositions.  This repository is for CSound tutorials I've worked on as well as new compositions.

## Works for Tone Generator 2

This set of Csound files is a work that builds on my first "Works for Tone Generator", originally titled "Six Miniatures for Timothy Mills", composed in eighteen years ago in 2004.  That work consisted of various tones generated in Csound, but arranged and shaped (e.g. faded in and out, voulme, etc.) in ProTools.

Those ProTools files are now almost lost to me, due to limitations of closed source software and compatibility.  My only access to those files is on an old Mac Mini with my old version of ProTools on it, but I cannot export the details of the session of anything to my more modern computers running Linux.

While I have worked with an open source audio program called Ardour, I thought the best way to compose a successor to "Works for Tone Generator" would be to write the entire composition in CSound, since this is its origin, and I would be able to store the composition in text in version control, unlike the binary forms that even an open source platform like Ardour would require.
